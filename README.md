# Logfile-Tool
Useful functions to make logfile reviewing easy and accurate.
Some control systems use a logfile system to store historical data containing some or all
of the events it computes such as commands, readback data and sensor inputs. This logfiles 
may then be reviewed and used for many purposes. Some of these logfiles can be extremely long 
and difficult to interpret. The goal of this project is to create a platform which a user can 
employ to make the job of reviewing and collecting data from logfiles easier, faster, and more accurate.
